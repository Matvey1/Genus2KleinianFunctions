The files contain Maple code to verify certain identities that appear in the paper "An explicit expression of the Richelot isogeny through Kleinian hyperelliptic functions".

The name of each file starts from the number of the corresponding formula in the arxiv version of the paper. The same files with numberings from the published version of the paper can be found in the folder /Maple-verifications/Lobjmat/.
